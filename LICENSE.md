## General Permissions

You are free to:

  - Clearly credit the Artist.

  - Release your version for free and under the same compatible license.

  - Do not claim the original Music as your own creations.

## Extended Permissions

- Authorized Users may request permission to use the Music in
  non-ephemeral content (e.g. YouTube videos, archives, or TikTok

  - Takes any formal complaint from the Artist seriously and responds
    within a reasonable timeframe.

  - Removes or edits the content if requested by the Artist.

  - Continues to follow all other terms of this license.

Failure to comply with such a request automatically revokes
authorization.

## Radio and Broadcast Use

- Licensed Radio Stations with paid contracts may broadcast the Music in
  compliance with the Artist’s commercial terms.

- If such a broadcaster is later discovered to be operating as a pirate
  or unlicensed station, any existing contract or permission is

## Remixes and Fan Works

- Non-commercial remixes are permitted if they meet the following:

  - Proper attribution to the Artist.

## Source material requirements

- Artists who release their music under this license must ensure that
  all samples, loops, vocals, and other audio material included in the
  Music are original, licensed as royalty free or legally permitted for
  redistribution under this license.

- Each Artist using this license accepts full responsibility for
  verifying the legitimacy of their source material.

- Music containing unlicensed, copyrighted, or otherwise infringing
  samples may not be released under this license.

  Music was clean and properly licensed, the Artist is fully responsible
  for the issue by:

  - Issue clarification

  - Retracting improper claims

  - Communicating with the claimant

  - or removing/replacing the infringing Music.

## Revocation of Rights

- Any violation of this license, or misuse of the Music, results in

  User who does not respond to a formal complaint or who fails to act
  respectfully toward the Artist’s concerns.

- Once revoked, the user must remove the content immediately upon
  notification.

## Duration of Revisions

- Once the Artist releases their Music under this license, it will
  remain licensed under the version number stated unless the Artist
  explicitly re-releases it under a newer version.

  - Listeners, creators, and broadcasters may continue using the work
    under that version’s terms indefinitely.

  - Newer versions of this license do not automatically replace or
    modify the license applied to previously released Music.

  original author to create new versions.

  - Artists may choose to adopt a newer version at any time.

  - All official versions remain publicly available for reference and
    transparency.
