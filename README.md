# Streaming Safe Music License (SSM)

*A community-friendly license for artists who want their music to be
free to use but protected from misuse.*

## About This License

The **Streaming Safe Music License (SSM)** is a custom music license
created to solve a gap between fully open licenses like Creative Commons, and restrictive commercial licenses.

SSM is designed specifically for music, not general creative works.

It allows:

- Free listening, sharing, and remixing (non-commercial)
- Use in streams/videos with proper credit
- Temporary uploads (up to 24h)
- Paid radio usage with conditions
- Artists to use royalty-free samples
- Respect for the artist’s objections

It forbids:

- Commercial use without permission
- Use of illegally sampled music
- Re-uploading for profit
- Ignoring takedown requests

## Purpose of SFML

Many independent artists want their music to be accessible but still
maintain control over where it appears.  
SFML gives musicians an easy template to license their tracks while:

- keeping creative freedom
- protecting artists from misuse
- informing listeners where music can and cannot be used
- supporting community use without legal confusion

## Using SSM for Your Own Music

If you are an artist and want to release your music under this license:

1.  Add the following line to your video/track description:

> Licensed under SSM v1.0 - https://github.com/Migats/ssm-license

2.  Include the full license text with your digital releases when
    possible (e.g., Bandcamp, downloadable ZIP files, track metadata).
3.  Use royalty-free samples only, to ensure users of your music are
    protected from copyright claims.

You can also modify the license for personal use but should change the
version or title if you do so.
